This script automatically fetches and displays the weather forecast for a location found on a webpage. It works by:

1. Extracting Location Data: The script looks for hidden location details in the webpageâ€™s code.
2. Fetching Weather Data: Once the location (latitude & longitude) is identified, the script requests weather information from an external weather service.
3. Displaying the Forecast: The script creates a visually styled weather report with temperature, humidity, and conditions for today and the coming days.
4. Embedding on the Page: The weather forecast is then neatly inserted into the webpage for easy viewing.
