# GGL Technical Test

This script automatically fetches and displays the weather forecast for a location found on a webpage. It works by:

## 1. Assigning the user to A/B test group: 
It assigns the user to the test or control group. This decides randomly whether the user can view the changes or not.

## 2. Extracting Location Data: 
The script looks for hidden location details in the webpage’s code.

## 3. Fetching Weather Data: 
Once the location (latitude & longitude) is identified, the script requests weather information from an external weather service.

## 4. Displaying the Forecast: 
The script creates a visually styled weather report with temperature, humidity, and conditions for today and the coming days.

## 5. Embedding on the Page: 
The weather forecast is then neatly inserted into the webpage for easy viewing.
